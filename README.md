# The retail challenge

You have a file `Retail.csv` describing sales data for a hypothetical Camping Supplies store.
Using your tool of choice, answer the following questions:

1. Construct a report breaking down sales by country, sales channel, product and year. The report should be easy to navigate.
2. Provide a list of recommendations for improving the store's profit. Back your recommendations up with argument.
3. What additional data would you want to collect? What analyses would it empower you to run?
